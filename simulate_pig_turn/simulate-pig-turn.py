def estimate_turn_score(hold_at: int, num_trials: int) -> float:
    """
    Estimate the average score of a single turn of the dice game Pig.

    A turn works as follows. The player starts with a running total of 0 and
    rolls one die at a time.

    - If the die shows a 1, the turn ends immediately and the turn scores 0.
    - Otherwise, the die is added to the running total.
    - As soon as the running total is greater than or equal to hold_at, the
      player stops rolling, and the turn scores the running total.

    Parameters:
    - hold_at (int): The running total at which the player stops rolling.
    - num_trials (int): The number of turns to simulate.

    Returns:
    float: The average turn score over num_trials simulated turns.
